There once was a boy who didn't know what to do. He was in a relationship with a girl who was desperately in love with him. He didn't understand it, and she denied it, but it was there hanging thick and forboding. But how can love be so ominous? Well, dear reader, you will come to see that this boy not only does not know what to do. He also does not know what to feel. He does not know what is okay for him to feel. And certainly much less so what it is okay for him to admit that he feels. They call life a journey, and if it is to be such, the boy had only carried one rule of social conduct along in his pack. Whenever an other would come up alongside him on a trail, he would sit down and grab the same book, now greasy with dog-ears and cluttered with crossouts and underlines. In lettering faded from crisp grey to scabby yellow, the battered cover reads "Lie". 

The other gets one of the deepest underlines first, "fine, how are you?". Most of the time, it seems the chapter on passing gestures may as well have been this single phrase and the instruction: "Say the above. Move along". The boy was always consulting his book. It had become second nature. Then it became first nature. He knew the book by heart years ago. Now he knew it by accident.
