My lungs never actually feel empty. I can breathe out as hard as I can, squeezing my diaphragm until my chest feels like a hot cough, and yet still, my lungs feel just the same size. I see my chest bulge as I inhale, yet I cannot feel my lungs expanding. All my organs are that way. there is a notion I have that all organs have their own place and size, and are rigidly compartmentalized. But every so often, the fact of the matter becomes that they are squishing around competing for space, squirming against tendons and mucous membranes and other organs. The fact that it all stays relatively put together seems nothing short of a miracle. 
But the hardest thing of all is that right at this moment, my stomach is small. It is not a grapefruit-sized bulb sloshing at the bottom with acid and filled up the rest of the way with air like a caraffe. It is, in matter of fact, being crushed like a deflated balloon, without resistance. I fear that it will be crushed beyond repair. Fear is certainly evolutionarily favored here.

If honesty is the wreckage of words that falls through your head
than it is an unsalvageable wreckage of which I want no part.
Smoking behemoths of twisted metal hemorrhaging desperate imps
as they sink into crushing black, followed by a cloud of failed dead dots.

Pressure is always pushing down on us. But despite the extra weight I have to carry around, I am actually very appreciative of pressure. It's one of the few forced we experience that is trying to keep us together. Entropy is ripping the universe apart, and yet, in our little petri dish, we are entropy's subcontractors. Our cells take advantage of energy wells. We feed on nature's scraps and leave even less than we found. And we do quite well for ourselves. We just have to keep outrunning heat death. Good thing the universe is so big and we are so small. I am glad I can't imagine living a million years. Ten thousand lives for me. I am having enough trouble getting through one.

"Have you tried turning it off and then turning it back on?" I ask, smirking.

I am not an Information Technology worker. I thank Google every day for replacing human intelligence. They don't claim to have, and they don't claim to plan to. I know where they are headed though. I don't even care that the source is going to be closed.
