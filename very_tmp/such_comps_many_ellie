Introduction
Changes in resource stoichiometry and availability can drive changes in ecological community structure and ecosystem processes (Bowman et al. 1993; Baer et al. 2004; Johnson et al. 2009; Bobbink et al. 2010; van de Waal et al. 2010; Fujita et al. 2010). Increased nitrogen (N) deposition has led to the loss of biodiversity globally but the mechanism underlying these changes to competitive landscapes remains poorly understood (Blumenthal 2005; Clark et al. 2007; Chalcraft et al. 2008; Clark and Tilman 2008; Bobbink et al. 2010). Although direct competition for resources is often cited as the mechanism driving competitive outcomes (Dybzinski and Tilman 2007; Hautier et al. 2009; Brauer et al. 2012), there is evidence that alternative mechanisms dependent on physiological responses of species to increased N availability may influence community-level changes (Bobbink et al. 2010). Two such responses that give a competitive advantage to species by increasing their productivity are changing N source preference and plasticity in N allocation. Thus, variation in physiological responses to altered N availability among plant species may better predict subsequent community- and ecosystem-level changes (Johnson et al. 2008; Ashton et al. 2010; da Silviera Pontes et al. 2010; Davidson et al. 2011; Boudsocq et al. 2012).
N deposition and species loss
Global N deposition has increased following a boom in synthetic fertilizer production that has increased the amount of reactive N in the atmosphere. Historically N-limited systems have experienced an increased availability of the resource which has had effects on communities worldwide, facilitating invasion and causing biodiversity loss (Blumenthal 2005; Clark et al. 2007; Chalcraft et al. 2008; Clark and Tilman 2008; Bobbink et al. 2010). Altered N availability often changes the competitive dynamics of ecological communities (Johnson et al. 2009; Bobbink et al. 2010) and the mechanism behind this is frequently attributed to direct competition for
Youngblood 2
resources, most often light (Dybzinski and Tilman 2007; Hautier et al. 2009; Brauer et al. 2012). The light-competition hypothesis proposes that light is the new limiting resource in systems with increased N; plants that increase productivity in response to greater N availability accumulate biomass and shade out species that do not have a productivity response (Hautier et al. 2009). For this reason, studies investigating community responses to increased N deposition have often used biomass accumulation as a proxy for competitive ability (Funk and Vitousek 2007; Baer and Blair 2008; Chalcraft et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2008; Luangani et al. 2009; Vallano et al. 2012).
Although several studies have demonstrated that light limitation can affect competitive outcomes (Dybzinski and Tilman 2007; Hautier et al. 2009), other studies have provided support for alternate mechanisms explaining competitive dynamics that depend on species’ physiological responses to increased N availability (Bobbink et al. 2010). Examining these physiological responses allows a species’ competitive ability in a system of altered N availability to inform community-level changes as opposed to supporting that superior competitors are excluding inferior competitors by direct competition for resources. While strong competitors with increased N commonly increase productivity (Pennings et al. 2005, Suding et al. 2005; Funk and Vitousek 2007; Ashton et al. 2010; da Silviera Pontes et al. 2010), the mechanisms behind this response are often overlooked as a predictive tool of how communities may change with altered resource availability. Examining the responses of specific physiological traits to increased N availability associated with the acquisition and allocation of this resource reveals that there could be a variety of causes behind why a plant does not exhibit a productivity response including specific N source preference, a lack of plasticity in N allocation strategies, and further physiological barriers caused by increased tissue N (Figure 1).
Preferential acquisition of N forms
Nitrogen is most commonly acquired by plants in one of two inorganic forms, ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate (NO3-). Nitrogen deposition is only one way the relative pools of NH4+ and NO3-
Youngblood 3
can change and controls on microbial activity such as temperature, pH, and plant biological nitrification inhibition can have as significant of an influence on the availabilities of ecosystem N pools (Wedin and Tilman 1993; Subbarao et al. 2013). Because the availability of N forms can change, plant that can shift their N source preference can respond more opportunistically to altered N availability (Houlton et al. 2007).
There are energetic costs to taking up either form of inorganic N and a trade-off exists between the two whereby increasing the root influx capacity of one form is inversely related to the influx capacity of the other (Maire et al. 2009). Though NH4+ requires less energy to take up and store in plant tissues, it can become toxic if present in excess (Boudsocq et al. 2012; Britto and Kronzucker 2013). Alternatively, NO3- is easily acquired but energetically expensive to assimilate because it first must be converted to NH4+ (Zheng 2009; Boudsocq et al. 2012; Britto and Kronzucker 2013). Many species preferentially take up either NH4+ or NO3- and those with a strong preference often have physiological barriers that prohibit the uptake of the not preferred form such as sensitivity to NH4+ toxicity or atrophied NO3- uptake systems (Britto and Kronzucker 2013). When different forms of N are supplied in excess to systems, no one species is the best at acquiring all forms of N and this reflects strong preferences among plants for N forms (Suding et al. 2005; Miller et al. 2007; Maire et al. 2009).
Ashton et al. (2010) examined shifts in N source preference in four competitively distinct
alpine tundra plant species in Colorado, USA. When grown in monoculture, these species had
similar patterns of N uptake. However, when grown in pairs, the competitively superior species
shifted from preferentially taking up NO - to taking up NH + while the competitively inferior 34
species did not change patterns of resource uptake. This study suggests superior competitors may change N uptake strategies in response to the presence of a competitor while inferior competitors do not. Boudsocq et al. (2012) modeled plant N source preference and found that variations in preference likely have significant effects on plant productivity. In their proposed model, the
Youngblood 4
strategy that maximized productivity and minimized mineral N losses was an intermediate
preference for the two forms of N. This suggests that plants which do not show a rigid preference
for a form of N are able to accumulate more biomass and maximize NO3- uptake. Thus plants
exhibiting an intermediate preference for N forms are more likely to be able to capitalize on
changing availabilities of N pools (Houlton et al. 2007; Boudsocq et al. 2012). Conversely, plants
that have a strong preference for either NO - or NH + may be excluded with long term increases in 34
N availability and changing N pools (Miller et al. 2007; Ashton et al. 2010; Ocho-Hueso et al. 2010).
Plasticity in N allocation
Increased system N has been shown to decrease the carbon (C) to N ratio in some plants (Schade and Lewis 2006) but not in all, reflecting different capacities among plant species for N uptake (Pan et al. 2010). Decreased C:N ratios suggest that because plants are no longer limited by N they should have the potential to increase photosynthesis (Baer and Blair 2008; Pan et al 2010). Plant sensing of C:N ratios and response pathways are still poorly understood, but plant NH4+, amino acid, and C concentrations are known regulators of genes that stimulate and inhibit N uptake (Coruzzi and Bush 2001; Zheng et al. 2009) and N allocation to plant organs (Lam et al. 2003). To increase productivity, plants must exhibit plasticity in response to increased plant N by increasing N allocation to photosynthetic tissues (Onoda et al. 2004; Luangani et al. 2009). Plasticity is a change in phenotypic expression in response to environmental changes (Bradshaw 1965) and here refers to a plant’s ability to shift patterns of N allocation with altered N availability.
Furthermore, there is a trade-off between N allocation to cell walls versus photosynthetic tissues (Onoda et al. 2004; Feng et al. 2009). Nitrogen allocation to cell walls is used to synthesize and maintain plant defenses and is negatively correlated with productivity (Onoda et al. 2004; Feng et al. 2009). Alternatively, N allocation to photosynthetic tissue is used in rubisco
Youngblood 5
(Hikosaka and Shigengo 2009) and is positively related to productivity (Onoda et al. 2004; Feng et al. 2009; Luangani et al. 2009).
Though most plants preferentially allocate N to either cell walls or photosynthetic tissue, some species, including many successful invaders, are able to exhibit plasticity in N allocation strategies (Feng et al. 2009; Luangani et al. 2009; Davidson et al. 2011; Vallano et al. 2012). Luangani et al. (2009) examined Pinus strobus, an exotic species in a N-limited system, and found that P. strobus was able to increase N use efficiency in response to reduced nutrient availability by increasing C gains per unit of plant N via increased N allocation to photosynthetic tissue. Vallano et al. (2012) investigated how increased N deposition affects plant performance and competitive dynamics among five species native to California’s serpentine grasslands and the most common invader of this system, Lolium multiflorum. In growth chamber monocultures, three of the studied species, including L. multiflorum, responded to increased soil N and gaseous NO2 with increased shoot biomass. When grown with native species in increased soil N and gaseous NO2 treatments, L. multiflorum had the greatest mean relative yield potential. However, there were no significant changes to photosynthetic rates in response to treatments for any of the species. These results show that the exotic species responded more opportunistically to nutrient addition through increasing biomass accumulation and this productivity increase is a direct response to increased N availability, making L. multiflorum a strong competitor.
Barriers to productivity responses
Plants may not offset increased tissue N with increased photosynthesis if another nutrient becomes limiting (Luangani et al. 2009; Pan et al. 2010; Farrer et al. 2013). Plants in terrestrial ecosystems with increased N availability have been shown to become limited by phosphorus (Fujita et al. 2010; Ocho-Hueso et al. 2010; Vitousek et al. 2010), water (Lamb et al. 2007), light (Dybzinski and Tilman 2007; Hautier et al. 2009; Brauer et al. 2012), and C (Farrer et al. 2013)
Youngblood 6
and all of these limiting nutrients have different effects on plant physiology and ecosystem processes.
Farrer et al. (2013) investigated the physiological mechanisms behind altered competitive dynamics in response to increased N availability using two alpine tundra species, one that is a poor competitor in systems of increased N, Geum rossii, and one that is a good competitor, Deschampia cespitosa. Many plants respond to increased N availability by decreasing belowground biomass independently of whether or not that plant also exhibits a productivity response (Clark et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2008; Maire et al. 2009; Farrer et al. 2013). As Farrer et. al (2013) found, this reduction in plant biomass can have detrimental consequences for plant C storage if the plant does not gain biomass aboveground. G. rossii also had a significant reduction in its C:N ratio while D. cespitosa did not, suggesting that the plant has a physiological response to increased tissue N that inhibits increased photosynthesis. Reductions in C storage for G. rossii reduced nonstructural carbohydrate reserves and the number of preformed leaves, which could have negative effects on leaf emergence in the future. C limitation may result from NH4+ build-up in tissues (Britto and Kronzucker 2013) and be a barrier to assimilating N into organic forms because C skeletons are required for N assimilation (Monson et al. 2006). This study demonstrates how specific physiological responses to increased N availability and feedbacks to those responses can cause a species to be excluded. Studies like Farrer et al. (2013) that more closely investigate the mechanisms behind species responses to altered resource availability show the competitive exclusion of a plant species may be more complex than direct competition for resources whereby plants do not respond dynamically to changing resource availability by a potential host of mechanisms.
Conclusion
Variations in physiological responses to altered N availability may explain differing competitive abilities of plants and poor competitors in these altered ecosystems likely have a
Youngblood 7
physiological barrier that prevents increased productivity. Increased global N deposition will continue to have large effects on feedbacks between changes to ecosystem-level nutrient availability and community composition and is a known threat to global biodiversity loss (Blumenthal 2005; Clark et al. 2007; Chalcraft et al. 2008; Clark and Tilman 2008; Bobbink et al. 2010). Increased ecosystem N is only one piece of a larger framework of a globally changing climate and the superior competitors will be those species that are best able to utilize the available resources and be resilient to subsequent ecosystem changes.

The above diagram illustrates potential responses of a plant to increased N availability in an ecosystem, labeled pathways A-D. In pathway A, the plant is unable to take up system N and therefore does not change productivity. Pathways B-D successfully take up N, but plants exhibiting pathway B cannot assimilate N, which leads to toxicity in plant tissues and no productivity response. Pathways C and D both successfully assimilate N but differ in allocation of N. Plants in pathway C do not increase allocation to photosynthetic tissue with increased N availability and therefore do not exhibit as large of a productivity response as plants in pathway D, which increase N allocation to photosynthetic tissue and exhibit a large productivity response.
